# :postbox: About Me
My name is Rahul and I am a Computer Science student at Stony Brook University!

```cpp
class AboutMe {
public:
    int age = 19;
    vector<string> traits = {"curious", "dumb", "nerd"};
    vector<string> hobbies = {"coding", "math" , "competitions", "poker"};
}
```

I started coding when I was introduced to scratch. I started off using block Scratch code made simple platformer games, then moved onto languages like Python, C++ and Java. I have tried to sharpen my skills by making challenging projects in both the programming and mathematical aspects. I am interested in algorithms and data structures, and also the mathematics involved in computer science! However, Now I am trying to get creative by diving into Web Dev with languages like as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
